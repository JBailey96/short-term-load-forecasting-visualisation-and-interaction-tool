Minute of Project Supervision Meeting
======================================

Student Name: James Bailey
Project Module Code: CSC3002
Project Supervisor: Sean McLoone
Meeting Number: 17
Date of Meeting: 04/03/2019

Progress since last meeting, and decisions arrived at during meeting:
======================================
Solution:
* Demonstrated added linear regression functionality - regression model selection, list of variables used in the model, training data, fitting model
* Discussed about using precomputed models - decision to include the 
training start and end date in the regression models config for the UI
to have set by default when selecting the model, can choose to modify
* For more advanced models (e.g neural networks) preferable to have offline precomputed coefficients passed in - need a different way to predefine the model structure for these models
* Separate app to build models and generate the JSON config decided
was preferable to manually editing the config file 

Dissertation:
* Better format - numbered sections, refer to tables as tables and graphs as
figures, for table title them and reduce length of the columns
* Have a defined structure - Abstract, Contents, Introduction, 5 or 6 chapters
* Use daily average to get less points and a better visualisation of trends
* Temperature for a day will get much less correlation to load
differences than by half hour


Action Points:
==============
* Work on analysis dissertation - get it complete and to a professional standard
* Work on the solution to complete the regression model functionality + take 
changes on board (preset training data selection)


Date of next meeting:
