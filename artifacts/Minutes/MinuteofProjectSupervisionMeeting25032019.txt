Progress since last meeting, and decisions arrived at during meeting:
======================================
Main discussion was over the introduction section of the dissertation:
*power systems operations - their need for load forecasting
*non dispatchable/dispatchable power
*impact of small scale generation - offsets load
*displacement models + linear regression models - not just regression
*expand variable selection - based on prior heuristic knowledge + inclusion impacts load deviations
*different models required for different days -> have top manage their complexity

Action Points:
==============
For the dissertation I'm going to work on the chapters:
* Introduction: Problem Description - near completion, just need to make slight changes
* Solution Description - work in progress from last week
* Proposed System Design
