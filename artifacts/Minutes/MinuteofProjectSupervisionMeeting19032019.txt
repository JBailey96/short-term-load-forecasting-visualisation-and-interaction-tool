Project Supervisor: Sean McLoone
Meeting Number: 19
Date of Meeting: 19/03/2019

Progress since last meeting, and decisions arrived at during meeting:
======================================
Analysis:
*Talk about analysis tools in analysis - choice to share Python with development tools
*Add a 50% data subset test of the limited variables models - measure MAPE + visualise
*Explain the decision to use direct LASSO or the change in MAPE - differences in MAPE, LASSO is based upon mean squared error not MAPE
*FSR - for the whole dataset **time permitting**
*Compare differences in LASSO/FSR/LASSO Occurences list
*Linear regression top 18 100% most occuring vs Lasso up to 18
*Come up with one definitive list of variables

Dissertation Structure:
*Include user flow diagrams, Requirements informed from analysis in design - Solution Description and System Requirements
*how the s/w is goign to satisfy the requirements - proposed system design
*describe the organisation of code, choices made regarding Python - implementation
*Audience is an introduction for an analyst looking to understand load forecasting, will move onto other tools like 
Matlab - System Evaluation and Experimental Results

Implementation:
*Deciding the best model to use - SDLY for Holidays, SDLW regression correction for non-Holiday days

Action Points:
==============
For the dissertation I'm going to work on the chapters:
* Introduction: Problem Description [x]
* Solution Description
* Proposed System Design

& Finish implementing regression stories in flight + incorporate predict next day into solution


Date of next meeting:
====================+
25/03/2019



Agreed minute should be initialled by the supervisor.
