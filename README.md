# Short Term Electricity Load Forecasting Visualisation and Interaction Tool

The project is a software solution that provides an interactive data visualisation suite to support research in the area of short-term electricity load forecasting.  The intended users for this application are an educational and industrial audience. Users are able to discover patterns and characteristics in the data through dynamic visualisations of historical load data. Different load forecasting models are incorporated into the solution. The visualisation of forecasting models enable a systematic performance comparison of each modelâ€™s load forecasting accuracy.

### Preprocessing Data for Regression Models
Load data can be preprocessed to be able to add regression models to the data. 
Regression models and their variables are defined through a JSON configuration file. 
The variables the models need are added to the data as part of a preprocessing step.

#### Data configuration file structure example
```javascript
{
  "models": { //list of regression models
    "Test Model": { //Name of the model in the solution
      "description": "ABCDEFG", //optional: a textual description of the model e.g source, explanation of variables chosen
      "training": { //optional: the date day range the model was trained on
        "start_date": "2015-01-01", //YYYY-MM-DD - what the start date picker will default to
        "end_date": "2016-01-01" //YYYY-MM-DD - what the end date picker will default to
      },
      "variables": { //list of variables the model will use: the magnitude of the variable
        "Temperature Last Day": { //name of the variable
          "column": "Temperature", //column in the data to use for the displacement
          "displacement_unit": "Days", //what unit to displace the variable (Half Hours, Hours, Days, Weeks, Months, Years)
          "displacement_value": 1 //magnitude of the displacement
        }
      },
      "differential variables": { //list of variables the model will use: the result of base variable - displaced variable
        "Wind Speed Difference Last Day": {
          "column": "Wind speed",
          "displacement_unit": "Days",
          "displacement_value": 1
        }
      },
      "correction variable": { //one variable the model will use other variables to correct the difference it has from the base variable
        "Load Last Day": {
          "column": "Load",
          "displacement_unit": "Days",
          "displacement_value": 1
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Variable guidelines
* Variables should not be named 'None'
* If there is a correction variable there must be at least one variable or differential variable.

### Requirements for preprocessing
Requirements for preprocessing:
* Load data CSV file must be placed into the folder 'preprocessing'
* File must conform to the data contract field names and types
* If exists, the load data configuration JSON file must be placed into the folder 'preprocessing'
* Configuration file must conform to the configuration structure

### Steps to preprocess
Navigate to the preprocessing program:
```
cd <project-install-directory>\short-term-load-forecasting-visualisation-and-interaction-tool\preprocessing
```
Run the preprocessing program:
```
python process_csv.py
```

* Follow the console steps and find the CSV file in the program directory named as 'filename_processed.CSV'
* Move 'filename_processed.CSV' and (if exists) config file to \short-term-load-forecasting-visualisation-and-interaction-tool\data\load_data
* Rename 'filename_processed.CSV' to 'filename.CSV' 
* (if exists) Rename config file to 'filename_config.JSON'

## Running the application

```
cd <project-install-directory>\short-term-load-forecasting-visualisation-and-interaction-tool\preprocessing
```
Run the program in debug mode (Development):
```
python run.py debug
```
Run the program in production mode (Deployment):
```
python run.py
```

## Running unit tests
Run all unit tests:
```
coverage run -m unittest discover -p "*_test.py"
```
